# LPOO_36 PAC XON

 Our game is based on Pac Xon, that was inspired by Xenon and Pacman. The goal of the game is to cover 80% of the screen with walls. In the arena there are monsters, if they touch the player or a path in construction, the player looses a live.WHen he has no more lives to loose, it is game over.

## Implemented Features

> This section should contain a list of implemented features and their descriptions. In the end of the section, include two or three screenshots that illustrate the most important features.

## Planned Features

> This section is similar to the previous one but should list the features that are not yet implemented. Instead of screenshots you should include GUI mock-ups for the planned features.

## Design

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts: "Problem in Context", "The Pattern", "Implementation" and "Consequences".

## Known Code Smells and Refactoring Suggestions

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation, and suggest ways in which the code could be refactored to eliminate them. Each smell and refactoring suggestions should be described in its own subsection.

## Testing Results

> This section should contain screenshots of the main results of both the test coverage and mutation testing reports. It should also contain links to those reports in HTML format (you can copy the reports to the docs folder).

## Self-evaluation

> In this section describe how the work regarding the project was divided between the students. In the event that members of the group do not agree on a work distribution, the group should send an email to the teacher explaining the disagreement.
